# What I learned
## By Jawad

- Pull requests are an invaluable method of managing incomign changes from multiple developers. This allows multiple people to approve the code that is being added and adding in new perspectives in the process
- Issues are a way to track the different changes that need to be made on a project. You can reference specific commits and pull requests inside of an issue to mark it as resolved.
